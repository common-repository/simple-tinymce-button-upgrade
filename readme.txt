Description: I have decided to discontinue updates to this particular plugin.  Please read the plugin page for more info.

== Description ==
<strong>NOTE:</strong> I have decided to discontinue updates to this plugin.  The primary reason is the inclusion of the google fonts.  Adding all these fonts increased page load times.  I have another plugin, "Ultimate TinyMCE", which is the exact same as this plugin, but without the google fonts added.  It also has my most current updates to the tinymce editor.  I strongly urge you to read below, follow the instructions, and stay updated with my "Ultimate TinyMCE" plugin.

<strong>Solution:</strong> 

1. Disable and delete "Simply TinyMCE".

2. Download my "Ultimate TinyMCE" plugin <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ultimate-tinymce/">HERE</a>.  This plugin has all the same exact features os "Simple TinyMCE", just without the google fonts.

3. If you would still like the google fonts.  You can download my "Supreme Google Fonts" plugin <a target="_blank" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/supreme-google-webfonts/">HERE</a>.  They will work together.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your 'wp-content/plugins' directory, or download and install automatically through your admin panel.

     
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

3.  You will need to manually activate your buttons the first time you install.  You can do this by going to the admin panel, settings page, Ultimate TinyMCE.  Here, you can set your preferences.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= The color picker feature always shows hex code #000000 regardless of what color I click. =

This is a bug in the TinyMCE core software.  This bug, as far as I know, is only seen when using Mozilla Firefox version 7.  Until the good folks over at TinyMCE can provide an upgrade, the only solution right now is to use another browser.

= How do I use the Anchors button =

<ol><li>Highlight the text, image, or other content where you would like to insert the anchor.</li><li>Click the anchor button and enter a unique name for the anchor.</li><li>Now, highlight the text where you want the user to click TO BE SENT to the anchor you created.<li><li>Click the Link button in the toolbar, and on the popup window click anchors and choose the name of your unique anchor you created.</li></ol>

= I still don't see my buttons after activating the plugin =

You may have to click the button titled "enable kitchen sink" from your top row.  This will expand the editor buttons.

<strong>Update:</strong>This version now includes an admin panel.  All buttons are set to false as default.  To activate buttons, go to Settings -> Ultimate TinyMCE and tick the checkboxes for the buttons you would like to include in your editor.

* Fixed bug where having to save each row individually.  Now, you can make your changes to both rows, and save once.

= 3.2.1.2 =
* Made some minor adjustments to code.  Renamed my functions to be more unique.
* Beautified the admin panel settings page.
* Added settings menu page for each row of buttons.
* Added support links for bugs or issues.
* Added "Settings" link on plugin page.  This should make finding the plugin settings page easier.
* Included a new set of BIG smilies.  These will surely draw some attention on your pages.
* Added link to please vote for this plugin.

= 3.2.1.1 =
* Changed the "Explanation Text" to an image of each button.  Now you can visually see which button you are enabling or disabling on the settings page.
* Added a stylesheet for future upgrades.  This fixed a small bug where it was throwing an error.  I apologize if anyone was caught by this "speedbump".

= 3.2 =
* Added an admin menu where you can now choose which buttons you would like to include in your editor.
* Options can be found under Settings -> Simple TinyMCE.
* Simply check which buttons you would like to display in the editor rows.

= 3.1 =
* This is a major update.
* Added all 291 currently availably Google WebFonts to the drop-down list in the visual editor.  I'm on fire!!  (I opted to include this for free, as opposed to offering a paid premium plugin, so I hope you enjoy and appreciate).
* NOTE:  Using google webfonts may slow your browser the first time your page is loaded after installing the plugin.  This is typical to render all the fonts from Google.  Load times will be GREATLY reduced one your pages are cached.
* Changed all Google Webfonts to appear in ascending alphabetical order in the drop-down.
* Found and fixed a small potential security issue (better safe than sorry!).
* Re-wrote a majority of the code to give better functionality and logic.

= 2.2 =
* Due to popular request, one gentleman in particular, I have decided to code some Google fonts into the editor.  I have included 25 different google fonts.  I am considering a paid version which will include hundreds of google fonts... (but I have to check into legality issues first).
* Added a preview button which will allow you to view your editor from the front end without having to wait for your page to load.
* Added new buttons for citations, abbreviations, acronyms, and insertions and deletions.
* Added a button to view HTML code.  This is very useful because the default behavior of WordPress can wreak havoc on the code when switching between the visual and html editors.  This button will allow you to view source code without it stripping out all the HTML tags.
* Changed plugin name from "Simple TinyMCE Button Upgrade" to "Ultimate Visual Editor Button Upgrade".

= 2.1 =
* Performed an overhaul on the features.
* Upgraded the table feature to include expanded functionality.
* Now includes support for:
<ul><li>Advanced link control (you can now make links open in a popup window, and control the size of the window).</li><li>Advanced lists (you can now choose your style of ordered and unordered lists).</li><li>Advanced image control (Are you ready for this... you can now easily add mouseover and mouseout to your images).</li><li>Added ability to search and replace text.</li></ul>
* Rearranged the icons to make the editor more user-friendly.  Grouped like icons together.
* Enjoy!!

= 1.3 =
* Added two additional sets of emoticons (32 total).  These took me some time, so it'll be a little while; but in my next update I plan to include animated emoticons.

= 1.2 =
* Added support for emoticons.  Insert emoticons from your visual editor and they will be displayed on your blog posts/pages.
